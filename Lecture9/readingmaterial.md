# **Lecture 9: Authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**

---

## ðŸ”¸ **What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?**

**JWT** is a method to securely transmit data (like user identity) between two parties (client and server) as a **token**.

### ðŸ§  Simple Definition:

> A JWT is a digital ID card that your server gives to a user when they log in. The user shows it every time they access protected routes (like a dashboard).

## ðŸ”¸ **Why JWT is used?**

- âœ… To **verify** a user without storing session on the server.
- âœ… To **protect routes** (only logged-in users can access certain pages).
- âœ… JWT is **stateless**, meaning server doesnâ€™t need to remember users â€” just verifies token.

## ðŸ”¸ **Real-life Analogy:**

Imagine entering a concert:

1. You show your **ticket** at the gate (like your JWT).
2. Security checks if itâ€™s **valid** (token verification).
3. If valid, you enter; otherwise, access is denied.
